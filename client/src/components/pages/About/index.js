        Waluigi is the ultimate example of the individual shaped by the signifier.
        Waluigi is a man seen only in mirror images; lost in a hall of mirrors he is
         a reflection of a reflection of a reflection. You start with Mario – the wholesome
          all Italian plumbing superman, you reflect him to create Luigi – the same thing but
          slightly less. You invert Mario to create Wario – Mario turned septic
          and libertarian – then you reflect the inversion in the reflection:
          you create a being who can only exist in reference to others.
          Waluigi is the true nowhere man, without the other characters he reflects,
          inverts and parodies he has no reason to exist. Waluigi’s identity only
          comes from what and who he isn’t – without a wider frame of reference he is
          nothing. He is not his own man. In a world where our identities are shaped
          by our warped relationships to brands and commerce we are all Waluigi.
